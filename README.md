# ChatBot
It's a Discord bot that you can talk to if you are bored.

## Usage
You will be able to configure the personality of the bot by editing the file `/src/resources/personality.txt`.\
After setting his personality you can use these **commands** to start a conversation with the bot: 
#### /listen_to_me
The bot starts to listen to you.

#### /stop_listening
The bot stops listening to you and starts generating a response.\
It needs to be called after the `/listen_to_me`-command.

#### /leave
The bot leaves the current voice channel.\
It needs to be called after you finished using him.
